- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
- Use database.types.ts as the single source of truth for database schemas. Never modify this file manually.
- Use relevant mcp whenever you think it's required. Don't need to ask for my permission.
- Never give me solution that's a quick fix. Give me solution that follows industrial best practices.
